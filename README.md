# battleship

This is a recreation of the board game battleship. In it you can use drag and drop to deploy your ships. It was built using webpack and vanilla JS. The boards know when ships have been hit and report that visually on the coordinates. Once all ships of either board have been sunk, the game is over and a winner is reported.
